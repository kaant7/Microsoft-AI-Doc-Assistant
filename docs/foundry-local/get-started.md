# Get started with Foundry Local

In this quickstart, you create a console application that downloads a local AI model, generates a streaming chat response, and unloads the model. Everything runs on your device with no cloud dependency or Azure subscription.


::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later installed.


## Samples repository

The complete sample code for this article is available in the [foundry-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples). To clone the repository and navigate to the sample use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples.git
cd foundry-samples/samples/csharp/foundry-local/native-chat-completions
```

## Install packages


If you're developing or shipping on Windows, select the **Windows** tab. The Windows package integrates with the [Windows ML](/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview) runtime — it provides the same API surface area with a wider breadth of hardware acceleration.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local.WinML
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

### [Cross-Platform](#tab/xplatform)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

The C# samples in the GitHub repository are preconfigured projects. If you're building from scratch, you should read the [Foundry Local SDK reference](../reference/reference-sdk-current.md) for more details on how to set up your C# project with Foundry Local. 


## Use native chat completions API    

Copy and paste the following code into a C# file named `Program.cs`:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/native-chat-completions/Program.cs" id="complete_code":::

Run the code by using the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```


> [!NOTE]
> If you're targeting Windows, use the Windows-specific instructions under the Windows tab for the best performance and experience.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build errors referencing `net8.0`**: Install the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0), then rebuild the app.
- **`Model not found`**: Run the optional model listing snippet to find an alias available on your device, then update the alias passed to `GetModelAsync`.
- **Slow first run**: Model downloads can take time the first time you run the app.

## Use native chat completions API    

Copy and paste the following code into a Python file named `app.py`:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/native-chat-completions/src/app.py" id="complete_code":::

Run the code by using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'foundry_local_sdk'`**: Install the SDK by running `pip install foundry-local-sdk`.
- **`Model not found`**: Run the optional model listing snippet to find an alias available on your device, then update the alias passed to `get_model`.
- **Slow first run**: Model downloads can take time the first time you run the app.

## Use native chat completions API    

Replace the contents of `main.rs` with the following code:

:::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/native-chat-completions/src/main.rs" id="complete_code":::

Run the code by using the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Build errors**: Ensure you have Rust 1.70.0 or later installed. Run `rustup update` to get the latest version.
- **`Model not found`**: Verify the model alias is correct. Use `manager.catalog().get_models().await?` to list available models.
- **Slow first run**: Model downloads can take time the first time you run the app.
