# Integrate inference SDKs with Foundry Local

Foundry Local integrates with OpenAI-compatible SDKs and HTTP clients through a local REST server. This article shows you how to connect your app to local AI models by using popular SDKs.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later installed. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


## Samples repository

The complete sample code for this article is available in the [foundry-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples). To clone the repository and navigate to the sample use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples.git
cd foundry-samples/samples/python/foundry-local/web-server
```

## Install packages


If you're developing or shipping on Windows, select the **Windows** tab. The Windows package integrates with the [Windows ML](/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview) runtime — it provides the same API surface area with a wider breadth of hardware acceleration.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
pip install foundry-local-sdk-winml openai
```

### [Cross-Platform](#tab/xplatform)

```bash
pip install foundry-local-sdk openai
```

> [!TIP]
> We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts. You can create a virtual environment using either `venv` or `conda`.

## Use OpenAI SDK with Foundry Local

Copy-and-paste the following code into a Python file named `app.py`:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/web-server/src/app.py" id="complete_code":::

Reference: [Foundry Local SDK reference](../../reference/reference-sdk-current.md)
Reference: [Foundry Local REST API reference](../../reference/reference-rest.md)

Run the code using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see a streaming response printed in your terminal. On the first run, Foundry Local might download execution providers and the model, which can take a few minutes.
