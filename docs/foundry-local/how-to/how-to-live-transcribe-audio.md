# Live transcribe audio from a microphone with Foundry Local

Use Foundry Local's live audio transcription API to stream microphone audio and receive transcription results in real time. In this article, you create a console application that captures audio from your microphone, streams it to a local speech model, and prints transcription output as you speak.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) or later installed.
- A working microphone connected to your computer.

## Samples repository

The complete sample code for this article is available in the [foundry-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples). To clone the repository and navigate to the sample use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples.git
cd foundry-samples/samples/csharp/foundry-local/live-audio-transcription-example
```

## Install packages


If you're developing or shipping on Windows, select the **Windows** tab. The Windows package integrates with the [Windows ML](/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview) runtime — it provides the same API surface area with a wider breadth of hardware acceleration.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local.WinML
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

### [Cross-Platform](#tab/xplatform)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

The C# samples in the GitHub repository are preconfigured projects. If you're building from scratch, you should read the [Foundry Local SDK reference](../reference/reference-sdk-current.md) for more details on how to set up your C# project with Foundry Local. 


Install the [NAudio](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NAudio) package for microphone capture:

```bash
dotnet add package NAudio
```

## Live transcribe from microphone

The following code initializes the Foundry Local SDK, loads a streaming speech model, captures audio from your microphone using NAudio, and streams it to the live transcription API. Partial results appear as you speak, and final results are printed on a new line.

Copy and paste the following code into `Program.cs`:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/live-audio-transcription/Program.cs":::

The `CreateLiveTranscriptionSession` method returns a session that accepts raw Pulse-code modulation (PCM) audio and yields transcription results as an async stream. NAudio's `WaveInEvent` captures microphone audio at 16-kHz mono—the format the session expects.

Run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Speak into your microphone. You see real-time transcription output:

```
Listening... (press Ctrl+C to stop)
Hello, this is a test of the live transcription feature.
It transcribes audio from the microphone in real time.
```

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop recording. The model finishes processing any remaining audio and the application exits.

Install the [naudiodon2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/naudiodon2) package for microphone capture:

```bash
npm install naudiodon2
```

## Live transcribe from microphone

The following code initializes the Foundry Local SDK, loads a streaming speech model, captures audio from your microphone using naudiodon2, and streams it to the live transcription API. Partial results appear as you speak, and final results are printed on a new line.

Copy and paste the following code into `app.js`:

:::code language="javascript" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/javascript/foundry-local/live-audio-transcription/app.js":::

The `createLiveTranscriptionSession` method returns a session that accepts raw PCM audio and yields transcription results as an async generator. The naudiodon2 `AudioIO` captures microphone audio at 16 kHz mono 16-bit — the format the session expects.

Run the application:

```bash
node app.js
```

Speak into your microphone. You see real-time transcription output:

```
Listening... (press Ctrl+C to stop)
Hello, this is a test of the live transcription feature.
It transcribes audio from the microphone in real time.
```

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop recording. The model finishes processing any remaining audio and the application exits.

Install [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/) for microphone capture:

```bash
pip install pyaudio
```

## Live transcribe from microphone

The following code initializes the Foundry Local SDK, loads a streaming speech model, captures audio from your microphone using PyAudio, and streams it to the live transcription API. Partial results appear as you speak, and final results are printed on a new line.

Copy and paste the following code into `app.py`:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/live-audio-transcription/src/app.py":::

The sample uses the [cpal](https://crates.io/crates/cpal) crate for cross-platform microphone capture. The dependency is already listed in `Cargo.toml`.

## Live transcribe from microphone

The following code initializes the Foundry Local SDK, loads a streaming speech model, captures audio from your microphone using cpal, and streams it to the live transcription API. Partial results appear as you speak, and final results are printed on a new line.

Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following code:

:::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/live-audio-transcription/src/main.rs":::

The `create_live_transcription_session` method returns a session that accepts raw Pulse-code modulation (PCM) audio and yields transcription results as an async stream. The cpal input stream captures microphone audio at 16-kHz mono, which is the format the session expects.

Run the application:

```bash
cargo run
```

Speak into your microphone. You see real-time transcription output:

```
Listening... (press Ctrl+C to stop)
Hello, this is a test of the live transcription feature.
It transcribes audio from the microphone in real time.
```

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop recording. The model finishes processing any remaining audio and the application exits.
