# Tutorial: Build a multi-turn chat assistant with Foundry Local

In this tutorial, you build an interactive chat assistant that runs entirely on your device. The assistant maintains conversation context across multiple exchanges, so it remembers what you discussed earlier in the conversation. You use the Foundry Local SDK to select a model, define a system prompt, and stream responses token by token.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up a project and install the Foundry Local SDK
> * Browse the model catalog and select a model
> * Define a system prompt to shape assistant behavior
> * Implement multi-turn conversation with message history
> * Stream responses for a responsive experience
> * Clean up resources when the conversation ends

## Prerequisites

- A Windows, macOS, or Linux computer with at least 8 GB of RAM.

## Install packages


If you're developing or shipping on Windows, select the **Windows** tab. The Windows package integrates with the [Windows ML](/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview) runtime — it provides the same API surface area with a wider breadth of hardware acceleration.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local.WinML
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

### [Cross-Platform](#tab/xplatform)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

The C# samples in the GitHub repository are preconfigured projects. If you're building from scratch, you should read the [Foundry Local SDK reference](../reference/reference-sdk-current.md) for more details on how to set up your C# project with Foundry Local. 


## Browse the catalog and select a model

The Foundry Local SDK provides a model catalog that lists all available models. In this step, you initialize the SDK and select a model for your chat assistant.

- Open `Program.cs` and replace its contents with the following code to initialize the SDK and select a model:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-chat-assistant/Program.cs" id="init":::

    The `GetModelAsync` method accepts a model alias, which is a short friendly name that maps to a specific model in the catalog. The `DownloadAsync` method fetches the model weights to your local cache, and `LoadAsync` makes the model ready for inference.

## Define a system prompt

A system prompt sets the assistant's personality and behavior. It's the first message in the conversation history and the model references it throughout the conversation.

Add a system prompt to shape how the assistant responds:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-chat-assistant/Program.cs" id="system_prompt":::

> [!TIP]
> Experiment with different system prompts to change the assistant's behavior. For example, you can instruct it to respond as a pirate, a teacher, or a domain expert.

## Implement multi-turn conversation

A chat assistant needs to maintain context across multiple exchanges. You achieve this by keeping a list of all messages (system, user, and assistant) and sending the full list with each request. The model uses this history to generate contextually relevant responses.

Add a conversation loop that:

- Reads user input from the console.
- Appends the user message to the history.
- Sends the complete history to the model.
- Appends the assistant's response to the history for the next turn.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-chat-assistant/Program.cs" id="conversation_loop":::

Each call to `CompleteChatAsync` receives the full message history. This is how the model "remembers" previous turns — it doesn't store state between calls.

## Add streaming responses

Streaming prints each token as it's generated, which makes the assistant feel more responsive. Replace the `CompleteChatAsync` call with `CompleteChatStreamingAsync` to stream the response token by token.

Update the conversation loop to use streaming:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-chat-assistant/Program.cs" id="streaming":::

The streaming version accumulates the full response so it can be added to the conversation history after the stream completes.

## Complete code

Replace the contents of `Program.cs` with the following complete code:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-chat-assistant/Program.cs" id="complete_code":::

Run the chat assistant:

```bash
dotnet run
```

You see output similar to:

```
Downloading model: 100.00%
Model loaded and ready.

Chat assistant ready! Type 'quit' to exit.

You: What is photosynthesis?
Assistant: Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert sunlight, water, and carbon
dioxide into glucose and oxygen. It mainly happens in the leaves, inside structures
called chloroplasts.

You: Why is it important for other living things?
Assistant: It's essential because photosynthesis produces the oxygen that most living things
breathe. It also forms the base of the food chain — animals eat plants or eat other
animals that depend on plants for energy.

You: quit
Model unloaded. Goodbye!
```

Notice how the assistant remembers context from previous turns — when you ask "Why is it important for other living things?", it knows you're still talking about photosynthesis.

## Browse the catalog and select a model

The Foundry Local SDK provides a model catalog that lists all available models. In this step, you initialize the SDK and select a model for your chat assistant.

1. Create a file called `index.js`.

1. Add the following code to initialize the SDK and select a model:

    :::code language="javascript" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/javascript/foundry-local/tutorial-chat-assistant/app.js" id="init":::

    The `getModel` method accepts a model alias, which is a short friendly name that maps to a specific model in the catalog. The `download` method fetches the model weights to your local cache, and `load` makes the model ready for inference.

## Define a system prompt

A system prompt sets the assistant's personality and behavior. It's the first message in the conversation history and the model references it throughout the conversation.

Add a system prompt to shape how the assistant responds:

:::code language="javascript" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/javascript/foundry-local/tutorial-chat-assistant/app.js" id="system_prompt":::

## Browse the catalog and select a model

The Foundry Local SDK provides a model catalog that lists all available models. In this step, you initialize the SDK and select a model for your chat assistant.

1. Create a file called `main.py`.

1. Add the following code to initialize the SDK and select a model:

    :::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/tutorial-chat-assistant/src/app.py" id="init":::

    The `get_model` method accepts a model alias, which is a short friendly name that maps to a specific model in the catalog. The `download` method fetches the model weights to your local cache, and `load` makes the model ready for inference.

## Define a system prompt

A system prompt sets the assistant's personality and behavior. It's the first message in the conversation history and the model references it throughout the conversation.

## Implement multi-turn conversation

A chat assistant needs to maintain context across multiple exchanges. You achieve this by keeping a vector of all messages (system, user, and assistant) and sending the full list with each request. The model uses this history to generate contextually relevant responses.

Add a conversation loop that:

- Reads user input from the console.
- Appends the user message to the history.
- Sends the complete history to the model.
- Appends the assistant's response to the history for the next turn.

:::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/tutorial-chat-assistant/src/main.rs" id="conversation_loop":::

Each call to `complete_chat` receives the full message history. This is how the model "remembers" previous turns — it doesn't store state between calls.

## Add streaming responses

Streaming prints each token as it's generated, which makes the assistant feel more responsive. Replace the `complete_chat` call with `complete_streaming_chat` to stream the response token by token.

You see output similar to:

```
Downloading model: 100.00%

## Clean up resources

The model weights remain in your local cache after you unload a model. This means the next time you run the application, the download step is skipped and the model loads faster. No extra cleanup is needed unless you want to reclaim disk space.
