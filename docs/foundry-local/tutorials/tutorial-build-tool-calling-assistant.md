# Tutorial: Build an AI assistant with tool calling

Build an AI assistant that goes beyond conversation — it can call functions to perform actions. The assistant decides when a function is needed, you execute it, and feed the result back. Everything runs locally with the Foundry Local SDK.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up a project and install the Foundry Local SDK
> * Define tools the assistant can call
> * Send a message that triggers tool use
> * Execute the tool and return results to the model
> * Handle the complete tool calling loop
> * Clean up resources

## Prerequisites

- A Windows, macOS, or Linux computer with at least 8 GB of RAM.

## Samples repository

The complete sample code for this article is available in the [foundry-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples). To clone the repository and navigate to the sample use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples.git
cd foundry-samples/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling
```

## Install packages


If you're developing or shipping on Windows, select the **Windows** tab. The Windows package integrates with the [Windows ML](/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview) runtime — it provides the same API surface area with a wider breadth of hardware acceleration.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local.WinML
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

### [Cross-Platform](#tab/xplatform)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

The C# samples in the GitHub repository are preconfigured projects. If you're building from scratch, you should read the [Foundry Local SDK reference](../reference/reference-sdk-current.md) for more details on how to set up your C# project with Foundry Local. 


## Define tools

Tool calling lets the model request that your code runs a function and returns the result. You define the available tools as a list of JSON schemas that describe each function's name, purpose, and parameters.

1. Open `Program.cs` and add the following tool definitions:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/Program.cs" id="tool_definitions":::

    Each tool definition includes a `name`, a `description` that helps the model decide when to use it, and a `parameters` schema that describes the expected input.

1. Add the C# methods that implement each tool:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/Program.cs" id="tool_definitions":::

    The model doesn't run these functions directly. It returns a tool call request with the function name and arguments, and your code executes the function.

## Send a message that triggers tool use

Initialize the Foundry Local SDK, load a model, and send a message that the model can answer by calling a tool.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/Program.cs" id="init":::

When the model determines that a tool is needed, the response contains `ToolCalls` instead of a regular text message. The next step shows how to detect and handle these calls.

## Execute the tool and return results

After the model responds with a tool call, you extract the function name and arguments, run the function, and send the result back.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/Program.cs" id="tool_loop":::

The key steps in the tool calling loop are:

1. **Detect tool calls** — check `response.Choices[0].Message.ToolCalls`.
1. **Execute the function** — parse the arguments and call your local function.
1. **Return the result** — add a message with role `tool` and the matching `ToolCallId`.
1. **Get the final answer** — the model uses the tool result to generate a natural response.

## Handle the complete tool calling loop

Here's the complete application that combines tool definitions, SDK initialization, and the tool calling loop into a single runnable file.

Replace the contents of `Program.cs` with the following complete code:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/Program.cs" id="complete_code":::

Run the tool-calling assistant:

```bash
dotnet run
```

You see output similar to:

```
Downloading model: 100.00%
Model loaded and ready.

Tool-calling assistant ready! Type 'quit' to exit.

You: What's the weather like today?
  Tool call: get_weather({"location":"current location"})
Assistant: The weather today is sunny with a temperature of 22°C.

You: What is 245 * 38?
  Tool call: calculate({"expression":"245 * 38"})
Assistant: 245 multiplied by 38 equals 9,310.

You: quit
Model unloaded. Goodbye!
```

The model decides when to call a tool based on the user's message. For a weather question it calls `get_weather`, for math it calls `calculate`, and for general questions it responds directly without any tool calls.

## Define tools

Tool calling lets the model request that your code runs a function and returns the result. You define the available tools as a list of JSON schemas that describe each function's name, purpose, and parameters.

1. Create a file called `index.js`.

1. Add the following tool definitions:

    :::code language="javascript" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/javascript/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/app.js" id="tool_definitions":::

    Each tool definition includes a `name`, a `description` that helps the model decide when to use it, and a `parameters` schema that describes the expected input.

1. Add the JavaScript functions that implement each tool:

    :::code language="javascript" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/javascript/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/app.js" id="tool_definitions":::

    The model doesn't run these functions directly. It returns a tool call request with the function name and arguments, and your code executes the function.

## Send a message that triggers tool use

Initialize the Foundry Local SDK, load a model, and send a message that the model can answer by calling a tool.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/javascript/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/app.js" id="init":::

When the model determines that a tool is needed, the response contains `tool_calls` instead of a regular text message. The next step shows how to detect and handle these calls.

## Execute the tool and return results

After the model responds with a tool call, you extract the function name and arguments, run the function, and send the result back.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/javascript/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/app.js" id="tool_loop":::

The key steps in the tool calling loop are:

1. **Detect tool calls** — check `response.choices[0]?.message?.tool_calls`.
1. **Execute the function** — parse the arguments and call your local function.
1. **Return the result** — add a message with role `tool` and the matching `tool_call_id`.
1. **Get the final answer** — the model uses the tool result to generate a natural response.

## Handle the complete tool calling loop

Here's the complete application that combines tool definitions, SDK initialization, and the tool calling loop into a single runnable file.

Create a file named `index.js` and add the following complete code:

:::code language="javascript" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/javascript/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/app.js" id="complete_code":::

Run the tool-calling assistant:

```bash
node index.js
```

You see output similar to:

```
Downloading model: 100.00%
Model downloaded.

The model decides when to call a tool based on the user's message. For a weather question it calls `get_weather`, for math it calls `calculate`, and for general questions it responds directly without any tool calls.

## Define tools

Tool calling lets the model request that your code runs a function and returns the result. You define the available tools as a list of JSON schemas that describe each function's name, purpose, and parameters.

Create a file called `main.py` and add the following tool definitions:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/src/app.py" id="tool_definitions":::

Each tool definition includes a `name`, a `description` that helps the model decide when to use it, and a `parameters` schema that describes the expected input.

Next, add the Python functions that implement each tool:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/src/app.py" id="tool_definitions":::

The model doesn't run these functions directly. It returns a tool call request with the function name and arguments, and your code executes the function.

## Send a message that triggers tool use

Initialize the Foundry Local SDK, load a model, and send a message that the model can answer by calling a tool.

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/src/app.py" id="init":::

```

You see output similar to:

## Define tools

Tool calling lets the model request that your code runs a function and returns the result. You define the available tools as a list of JSON schemas that describe each function's name, purpose, and parameters.

1. Add the `serde_json` dependency for JSON handling:

    ```bash
    cargo add serde_json
    ```

1. Open `src/main.rs` and add the following tool definitions:

    :::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/src/main.rs" id="tool_definitions":::

    Each tool definition includes a `name`, a `description` that helps the model decide when to use it, and a `parameters` schema that describes the expected input.

1. Add the Rust functions that implement each tool:

    :::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/src/main.rs" id="tool_definitions":::

    The model doesn't run these functions directly. It returns a tool call request with the function name and arguments, and your code executes the function.

## Send a message that triggers tool use

Initialize the Foundry Local SDK, load a model, and send a message that the model can answer by calling a tool.

:::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/src/main.rs" id="init":::

When the model determines that a tool is needed, the response contains `tool_calls` instead of a regular text message. The next step shows how to detect and handle these calls.

## Execute the tool and return results

After the model responds with a tool call, you extract the function name and arguments, run the function, and send the result back.

:::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/tutorial-tool-calling/src/main.rs" id="tool_loop":::

The key steps in the tool calling loop are:

1. **Detect tool calls** — check `response.choices[0].message.tool_calls`.
1. **Execute the function** — parse the arguments and call your local function.
1. **Return the result** — add a message with role `tool` and the matching tool call ID.
1. **Get the final answer** — the model uses the tool result to generate a natural response.

## Handle the complete tool calling loop

Here's the complete application that combines tool definitions, SDK initialization, and the tool calling loop into a single runnable file.

Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following complete code:

You: What's the weather like today?
  Tool call: get_weather({"location":"current location"})
Assistant: The weather today is sunny with a temperature of 22°C.

You: What is 245 * 38?
  Tool call: calculate({"expression":"245 * 38"})
Assistant: 245 multiplied by 38 equals 9,310.

You: quit
Model unloaded. Goodbye!
```

The model decides when to call a tool based on the user's message. For a weather question it calls `get_weather`, for math it calls `calculate`, and for general questions it responds directly without any tool calls.

## Clean up resources

The model weights remain in your local cache after you unload a model. This means the next time you run the application, the download step is skipped and the model loads faster. No extra cleanup is needed unless you want to reclaim disk space.
