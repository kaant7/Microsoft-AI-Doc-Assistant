# Tutorial: Build a voice-to-text note taker

Build an application that converts spoken audio into organized notes — entirely on your device. The app first transcribes an audio file using a speech-to-text model, then uses a chat model to summarize and organize the transcription into clean notes.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up a project and install the Foundry Local SDK
> * Load a speech-to-text model and transcribe an audio file
> * Load a chat model and summarize the transcription
> * Combine transcription and summarization into a complete app
> * Clean up resources

## Prerequisites

- A Windows, macOS, or Linux computer with at least 8 GB of RAM.
- A `.wav` audio file to transcribe (the tutorial uses a sample file).

## Install packages


## Samples repository

The complete sample code for this article is available in the [foundry-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples). To clone the repository and navigate to the sample use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples.git
cd foundry-samples/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text
```


If you're developing or shipping on Windows, select the **Windows** tab. The Windows package integrates with the [Windows ML](/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview) runtime — it provides the same API surface area with a wider breadth of hardware acceleration.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local.WinML
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

### [Cross-Platform](#tab/xplatform)

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

The C# samples in the GitHub repository are preconfigured projects. If you're building from scratch, you should read the [Foundry Local SDK reference](../reference/reference-sdk-current.md) for more details on how to set up your C# project with Foundry Local. 


## Transcribe an audio file

In this step, you load a speech-to-text model and transcribe an audio file. The Foundry Local SDK uses the `whisper` model alias to select the best Whisper variant for your hardware.

- Open `Program.cs` and replace its contents with the following code to initialize the SDK, load the speech model, and transcribe an audio file:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/Program.cs" id="transcription":::

    The `GetAudioClientAsync` method returns a client for audio operations. The `TranscribeAudioStreamingAsync` method streams transcription chunks as they become available. You accumulate the text so you can pass it to the chat model in the next step.

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `"meeting-notes.wav"` with the path to your audio file. Supported formats include WAV, MP3, and FLAC.

## Summarize the transcription

Now use a chat model to organize the raw transcription into structured notes. Load the `qwen2.5-0.5b` model and send the transcription as context with a system prompt that instructs the model to produce clean, summarized notes.

Add the following code after the transcription step:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/Program.cs" id="summarization":::

The system prompt shapes the model's output format. By instructing it to produce "organized, concise notes with bullet points," you get structured content rather than a raw paraphrase.

## Combine into a complete app

Replace the contents of `Program.cs` with the following complete code that transcribes an audio file and summarizes the transcription:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/csharp/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/Program.cs" id="complete_code":::

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `"meeting-notes.wav"` with the path to your audio file. Supported formats include WAV, MP3, and FLAC.

Run the note taker:

```bash
dotnet run
```

You see output similar to:

OK so let's get started with the weekly sync. First, the backend
API is nearly done. Sarah finished the authentication endpoints
yesterday. We still need to add rate limiting before we go to
staging. On the frontend, the dashboard redesign is about seventy
percent complete. Jake, can you walk us through the new layout?
Great. The charts look good. I think we should add a filter for
date range though. For testing, we have about eighty percent code
coverage on the API. We need to write integration tests for the
new auth flow before Friday. Let's plan to do a full regression
test next Tuesday before the release. Any blockers? OK, sounds
like we are in good shape. Let's wrap up.

## Transcribe an audio file

In this step, you load a speech-to-text model and transcribe an audio file. The Foundry Local SDK uses the `whisper` model alias to select the best Whisper variant for your hardware.

1. Create a file called `app.js`.

1. Add the following code to initialize the SDK, load the speech model, and transcribe an audio file:

    :::code language="javascript" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/javascript/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/app.js" id="transcription":::

    The `createAudioClient` method returns a client for audio operations. The `transcribe` method accepts a file path and returns an object with a `text` property containing the transcribed content.

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `'./meeting-notes.wav'` with the path to your audio file. Supported formats include WAV, MP3, and FLAC.

## Summarize the transcription

Now use a chat model to organize the raw transcription into structured notes. Load the `qwen2.5-0.5b` model and send the transcription as context with a system prompt that instructs the model to produce clean, summarized notes.

Add the following code after the transcription step:

## Transcribe an audio file

In this step, you load a speech-to-text model and transcribe an audio file. The Foundry Local SDK uses the `whisper` model alias to select the best Whisper variant for your hardware.

1. Create a file called `app.py`.

1. Add the following code to initialize the SDK, load the speech model, and transcribe an audio file:

    :::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/src/app.py" id="transcription":::

    The `get_audio_client` method returns a client for audio operations. The `transcribe` method accepts a file path and returns an object with a `text` property containing the transcribed content.

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `"meeting-notes.wav"` with the path to your audio file. Supported formats include WAV, MP3, and FLAC.

## Summarize the transcription

Now use a chat model to organize the raw transcription into structured notes. Load the `qwen2.5-0.5b` model and send the transcription as context with a system prompt that instructs the model to produce clean, summarized notes.

Add the following code after the transcription step:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/src/app.py" id="summarization":::

The system prompt shapes the model's output format. By instructing it to produce "organized, concise notes with bullet points," you get structured content rather than a raw paraphrase.

## Combine into a complete app

Create a file named `app.py` and add the following complete code that transcribes an audio file and summarizes the transcription:

:::code language="python" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/src/app.py" id="complete_code":::

## Transcribe an audio file

In this step, you load a speech-to-text model and transcribe an audio file. The Foundry Local SDK uses the `whisper` model alias to select the best Whisper variant for your hardware.

- Open `src/main.rs` and replace its contents with the following code to initialize the SDK, load the speech model, and transcribe an audio file:

    :::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/src/main.rs" id="transcription":::

    The `create_audio_client` method returns a client for audio operations. The `transcribe` method accepts a file path and returns an object with a `text` field containing the transcribed content.

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `"meeting-notes.wav"` with the path to your audio file. Supported formats include WAV, MP3, and FLAC.

## Summarize the transcription

Now use a chat model to organize the raw transcription into structured notes. Load the `qwen2.5-0.5b` model and send the transcription as context with a system prompt that instructs the model to produce clean, summarized notes.

Add the following code after the transcription step, inside the `main` function:

:::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/src/main.rs" id="summarization":::

The system prompt shapes the model's output format. By instructing it to produce "organized, concise notes with bullet points," you get structured content rather than a raw paraphrase.

## Combine into a complete app

Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following complete code that transcribes an audio file and summarizes the transcription:

:::code language="rust" source="~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/tutorial-voice-to-text/src/main.rs" id="complete_code":::

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `"meeting-notes.wav"` with the path to your audio file. Supported formats include WAV, MP3, and FLAC.

Run the note taker:

```bash

## Clean up resources

The model weights remain in your local cache after you unload a model. This means the next time you run the application, the download step is skipped and the model loads faster. No extra cleanup is needed unless you want to reclaim disk space.
